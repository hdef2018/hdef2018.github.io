<h1><a id="travel"></a>Getting to Armagh</h1></p><p>

Northern Ireland can be reached by air from many cities in Britain, mainland Europe and beyond<!-- , or by ferry from England or Scotland -->. The nearest major airports to Armagh are in Dublin (Republic of Ireland) and Belfast (two airports). Travelling to Armagh via <strong><a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/">Dublin Airport</a></strong> in the Republic of Ireland is likely the most convenient route, as a <strong>direct bus service exists between Dublin Airport and Armagh</strong>, unlike either of the Belfast airports. Dublin Airport is well connected with many major European airports and is ~80 miles from Armagh. Note, however, that a separate visa may be required for certain nationals. Belfast has two airports, <strong><a href="https://www.belfastairport.com">Belfast International Airport</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.belfastcityairport.com">Belfast City Airport</a></strong>, both are ~40 miles from Armagh and are well connected with major UK and European airports. Getting to Armagh from either of the Belfast airports will require a bus from the airport to Belfast city centre before travelling onwards to Armagh.</p><p>

<a id="dublin"></a><h1>From Dublin Airport</h1></p><p>
All buses from Dublin Airport to Armagh/Newry depart from Coach Zone 11 outside Terminal 1 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2Zip5Xr8LAy">Google Maps</a>, or see the bus stop labelled <a href="#maps">in the map below</a>). The Translink X4 service connects Dublin Airport directly to Armagh, with a journey time of about 90 minutes. <!-- There are only a small number of services each way, so it is advisable to consult the <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Goldline/Timetables/">timetable</a> before travelling. --> The departure times are indicated below, <strong> however the timetable is subject to change from 1 September 2018, so check this page again closer to the conference for an updated timetable. </strong> X4 bus tickets can be booked online up to a month in advance, the booking page can be found <a href="https://secure.translink.co.uk/Buy-Online/Desktop/Goldline-X3X4-Ticket/Step-1/">here</a>. Pre-booked tickets can often be cheaper than tickets purchased from the driver on the day, but must be booked at least 24 hours in advance of travel. If you wish to purchase a ticket from the driver, both Euros and Pounds Sterling will be accepted.</p><p>
